# Introduction
Windshield wipers generally necessary for maintaining appropriate vision for the driver, especially in modern high-speed cars. Rain, snow, mud, pollen, frost, and other pollutants are swept away by wiper blades in cars. Most wipers include a low, high, and intermittent speed option, as well as an intermittent mode.The motor runs constantly when the wipers are set to low or high speed. In the intermittent mode, however, the wipers come to a halt between wipes. There are many different kinds of switches for wipers. In this project, the wiper blades' speed is varied in accordance with the rate of rainfall.
# Features

# Research
# Software Used
* STM CUBE IDE
# Component Description
The STM32F407 associate to the family of  microcontroller with an ARM cortex-M4 core that is designed on the RISC (Reduced-instruction-set Computing) architecture. This module includes high-speed embedded memory units such as flash memory with a storage capacity of one megabyte, static random access memory with a storage space of ninety kilobytes and four-kilobyte static ram as a backup memory unit. There are 12 GP sixteen bit timers, along with two pulse width modulation timers for motor speed management. There are also 2 GP thirty-two bit timers. With the use of three AHB buses and a thirty-two-bit multi AHB bus matrix, this component can connect to a variety of external devices via the APB bus.
# Working Procedure
In this project STM32F407G Microcontroller is used. When the push button is pressed first, the Red LED is ON and holds for 2 sec indicating Ignition key position at ACCESSORY. While pressing the button for second time, Blue LED is ON with the frequency of 1 Hz then followed by Green LED is ON with the frequency of 4 Hz and Orange LED is ON with the frequency of 8 Hz.

## Strength
* This project is helpful for the removal of dust, rain drops, snow and other scraps quickly
* This project allows for enhanced vision
* Supportive for escaping from accidents due to the rain drops in the windscreen
## Weakness
* The wipers may not clean some areas in automobiles
* Need to renewed the wipers after a predetermined amount of time
## Opportunity
* Safe driving
* High Potential
## Threat
* 
# 4W's and 1 H
