# Introduction
Windshield wipers generally necessary for maintaining appropriate vision for the driver, especially in modern high-speed cars. Rain, snow, mud, pollen, frost, and other pollutants are swept away by wiper blades in cars. In this project, the wiper blades' speed is varied in accordance with the rate of rainfall.
# Features
# Research
# Software Used
* STM CUBE IDE
# Component Description

# Working Procedure
In this project STM32F407G Microcontroller is used. When the push button is pressed first, the Red LED is ON and holds for 2 sec indicating Ignition key position at ACCESSORY. While pressing the button for second time, Blue LED is ON with the frequency of 1 Hz then followed by Green LED is ON with the frequency of
